# **Lab Report 4**

We learned how to use vim by running and editing test on one of the files from our past labs. 

# **Logging into our SSH account**

**Keyboard Inputs** 
- Type on your local terminal the following: "ssh cs15lfa23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu" (Your ieng6 account should have its own unique letters, put them where the "xx" go)
- ~~~
  <enter>
  ~~~
These inputs just get us logged into our remote terminal through the use of the "ssh" command.
