# **Lab Report 3**
**In summary**

In lab for week 4 and 5, we debugged programs by observing their symptoms and running tests. We also found out new terminal commands that help us navigate through more 

**Debugging Programs**

I will use the ArrayExamples and ArrayTests code, both were provided in Lab during Week 4. 

This is the code for ArrayExamples.java, which originally had a bug in it. 
~~~
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

import org.junit.Test;

public class ArrayExamples
{

  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr){
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }

}
~~~

This is the test that was ran on it which gave a failure inducing-input. The intent was for the inputted array to be outputted but with the elements in reverse order. 
~~~
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {

  @Test 
  public void testReversed()
  {
    int[] input1 = {2,4,6};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{6,4,2}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
}
